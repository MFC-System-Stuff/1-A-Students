    Names:

      - Enhanced Intelligence
      - Analysis
    Descriptions:
      - 10th iteration of OFA being passed down, a stockpiling quirk that has now completely evolved, no longer giving enhanced strength, but an ability to never need rest and to store anything, whether it be damage, pain, happiness, or even objects and people (with the ability to push them out of the quirk again.) It is theorised that this change has came about to prevent the destruction of future OFA users. While the quirk still stockpiles strength, it'll do this at a lesser rate.
      - This is a simple intelligence quirk making the brain more flexible and adaptable to new situations and obtained knowledge, this is a fairly strong quirk, but side effects include major migranes without at least 10 hours of rest.
      - Analysis is a quirk that displays information on anything the user wishes to inspect, bringing up a menu of sorts to help navigate the knowledge.
  Description: Toshiko Suko is the 10th holder of OFA and is sweet and caring, using xirs knowledge to aid them in battle. They wish to help everyone and make Deku proud.
